      <h2>Avenger End Story</h2>
      <p>When Thanos gathered the Infinity Stones so he could snap his fingers and destroy half of all life in the
        universe in Avengers: Infinity War, many superheroes disappeared. Despite the initial shock, few fans thought
        they were actually gone for good. After all, characters like Black Panther and Spider-Man had to return for
        scheduled solo sequels — and the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        And indeed, when Avengers: Endgame jumps forward five years after the events of Infinity War, the Avengers have
        to come up with a way to bring their friends back to life. They figure out how to travel back through time and
        collect the Infinity Stones for themselves. Hulk uses them to bring back everyone who disappeared half a decade
        prior just as Thanos jumps forward in time himself and attacks Avengers headquarters. Luckily, all of their
        dusted compatriots have returned and the group defeats Thanos and his minions.
       <br>
       <br>
       

        Their heroics, which are complicated by the mechanics of time travel, mess with the already confusing Marvel
        timeline: As the Avengers change the past, new, parallel universes branch off, creating new spinoff
        possibilities for once-dead characters. And, of course, their mission involves some sacrifice — real sacrifice.
        Several of the original Avengers die in their mission to bring back their disappeared fellow heroes.

    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Avengers Main Characters Who Dead</h2>
    <p> Here’s everyone who is dead — like, really dead — alive, and resurrected at the end of Avengers: Endgame.

      Tony Stark: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) sacrificed himself in order to save the universe at the end of
      Avengers: Endgame. He uses all the Infinity Stones to wish Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his army out of existence, but
      exerts so much strength that he dies in the process. The movie ends with Tony Stark’s funeral, and Captain America
      (Chris Evans) returns all the Infinity Stones to the places in the timeline where the Avengers stole them from.
      Nobody will be using the stones to bring Tony back.
    </p><br>
    <p>Black Widow: When Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) go to Voramir, they learn from Red
      Skull that they will have to sacrifice something they love in order to attain the Soul Stone. After an extended
      fight over which one of them will make the big sacrifice, Black Widow jumps to her death. When Hawkeye returns to
      Earth, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) suggests they use the Time Stone to bring her back. However, Red Skull told Hawkeye
      that Black Widow’s death is permanent. Later, the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) says that he tried to wish Black Widow back
      into existence when he held the Infinity Stones, but that it wasn’t possible because, as Red Skull confirmed, the
      magic of the Soul Stone requires a permanent sacrifice. So yes, it seems like she’s gone for good even though
      Black Widow is finally getting her own spinoff movie; presumably it will be a prequel.</p>
